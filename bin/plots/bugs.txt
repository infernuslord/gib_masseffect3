- The suicide result of [Jacob: The Gift of Greatness] does not appear to be set 
  correctly in ME2 save files, or ME3 checks the wrong plot bool (362). Other 
  mission results (marooned, arrested) have not been checked.

- Thane's death (citprs_hosp_thanedeath_d_dlg), line "Goodbye, Thane. Meet you 
  across the sea." incorrectly checks [DLC: Lair of the Shadow Broker] 
  completion via checking conditional_226 (this line probably intended to check 
  romance flags instead).

- Liara touring the Normandy in ME2 during [DLC: Lair of the Shadow Broker] does 
  not appear to have been stored correctly in plot bools (plot bool 6941).
